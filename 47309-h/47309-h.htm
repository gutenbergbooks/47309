<h2 class="p2">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">When</span>, in November last, I began to make Experiments
on Animal Electricity, of which I read some
account to the Royal Society on the 3d of December; I
was not only much hurried with business, but could not
procure a sufficient number of Frogs for the purpose. During
the last winter and spring, I prosecuted the subject
more fully and with greater attention; and, on the third
day of June, I read a second paper to the Royal Society, to
which I have, since that time, made additions. I shall
now state a summary of the chief circumstances I have
observed, with a few Remarks.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">OBSERVATIONS on the CIRCULATING and NERVOUS
SYSTEMS of FROGS.</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">As</span> my Experiments with Opium, as well as those on
Animal Electricity, have been performed on Frogs chiefly;
I shall premise some observations on their Circulating and
Nervous Systems.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> Heart consists of one Auricle and one Ventricle
only, their Aorta supplying their Air Vesicles or Lungs,
as well as all their other Organs; and, of course, their Venæ
Cavæ return the Blood from all parts to the Heart. The
Ventricle of their Heart contracts about sixty times in a
minute; and the purple colour of the Blood which is seen
within it, disappears after each contraction, or the Blood is
entirely expelled by its contraction. For upwards of an hour
after cutting out its Heart, a Frog can crawl or jump;
and, for upwards of half an hour longer, it contracts its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Legs when the Toes are hurt, though not with sufficient
force to more its Body from the place where it is laid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> Encephalon consists of Brain and Cerebellum,
each of which, on its upper part, is divided into two Hemispheres;
and, below, they are conjoined by thick Crura,
which form the Medulla Oblongata and Spinal Marrow,
both of which are proportionally larger than in Man, and
more evidently consist of two Cords. There are nine true
Vertebræ; and at the sixth of these, the Spinal Marrow
terminates in the Cauda Equina. The Sciatic Nerves are
formed by three pairs of Nerves, sent out below the seventh,
eighth and ninth Vertebræ, and by one pair from the Os
Sacrum. A Nerve, resembling our great Sympathetic
Nerve, passes downwards from the Abdomen into the Pelvis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days after cutting off the Head of a Frog at its
joining with the first Vertebra, I found it sitting with its
Legs drawn up, in their usual posture; and when its Toes
were hurt, it jumped with very considerable force. Its
Heart likewise continued to beat about forty times in a minute,
and so strongly as to empty itself and circulate the
Blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> several Frogs, after cutting off the back part of the
six undermost true Vertebræ, I took out all that part of the
Spinal Marrow with the Cauda Equina which they cover.
The lower Extremities were rendered insensible to common
injuries, and lay motionless, yet the Frogs lived several
months thereafter, and the wounded parts of their Backs
cicatrised; and the Bones of their Legs, which I fractured,
were re-united, the Blood circulating freely in their Vessels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is universally known, that if, after amputating the
Limb of a warm blooded Animal, we repeatedly irritate
the Nerves which terminate in Muscles, repeated Convulsions
of the Muscles are for some time produced; and
that in Frogs, and other cold blooded Animals, the Nerves
retain this power still longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> it has been commonly supposed, that, after irritating
the Nerve a given number of times, the effect ceases,
Authors conceiving that there is lodged in the Nerve some
fluid, or other energy which is exhausted by repeated explosions.
Instead of this, I have found that the time the
Nerves preserve their power is the same, whether we
irritate them or not; or that their energy is not exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
by irritation, unless the irritation be such as sensibly
alters their texture.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4"><span class="smcap">EXPERIMENTS with OPIUM.</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">I cut</span> one hole in the fore and upper part of the Cranium
and Dura Mater of a Frog, and another in the back
part of the lowermost Vertebræ, and then injected, from
the one hole to the other, a small syringe full of water, in
five ounces of which one ounce of Opium had been infused
for three days. The infusion, by this means brought into
contact with the whole surface of the Encephalon and Spinal
Marrow, produced almost instantly universal convulsions;
and, in less than two minutes thereafter, the Animal
was incapable of moving its body from the place where
it was laid. A quarter of an hour thereafter, I found the
Heart beating twenty-five times only in the minute; and so
feebly, that it could not entirely expel the Blood. When,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
half an hour thereafter, the Sciatic Nerves were pinched,
a light tremor only was excited in the Muscles of the Leg;
and Animal Electricity produced but feeble twitchings of
the Muscles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> infusion of Opium, injected in the same manner in
Rabbits and in a Pig, produced similar effects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> long ago<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> observed, that an infusion of Opium,
poured into the Cavity of the Abdomen of a Frog, after
cutting out its Heart, occasioned, in a few minutes, convulsions
of its hind Legs. I have since found, that, after
cutting off the Head, and cutting out the Heart of a Frog,
its hind Legs are considerably weakened by pouring an infusion
of Opium into the Cavity of its Abdomen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> an infusion of Opium poured into the Auricle
and Ventricle of the Heart of a Frog, instantly renders that
Organ incapable of contraction, and, even after the Aorta
has been previously cut, occasions convulsions of the Legs,
yet I have not found that by Opium applied to the Brain,
the Spinal Marrow, the Heart, or Abdominal Viscera, the
Muscles of the Legs were so entirely killed as not to perform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
some motion when their Nerves were pinched, or
when they were acted on by Animal Electricity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> taking out the lower half of the Spinal Marrow,
and likewise cutting transversely all the parts at the Pelvis,
except the Crural Arteries and Veins and Lymphatics,
which probably accompany them, I found that an infusion
of Opium, applied to the Skin and Muscles of the Legs,
affected the superior parts of the Body<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>: more probably,
in my opinion, by absorption, than through any minute
remanent branches of the Nerves, especially as I do not
find, on laying the Vessels so prepared over a gold probe,
and touching with it Zinc laid under the Spine, that convulsions
of the Legs can be excited. At the same time, the
quantity of Opium absorbed is so small, that I could not
distinguish its smell or taste in the Blood; nor did I find
these distinguishable, in other Experiments, in which the
Frogs were violently convulsed after applying the infusion
to the surface of their Skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Animal</span> Electricity or different metals applied to the
Head of a Frog, or to any part of its Spine above its sixth
Vertebra, do not occasion convulsions of its hind Legs.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<p class="vh"><a name="c12" id="c12">c12</a></p>

<h2 class="p4"><span class="smcap">COROLLARIES from the above FACTS and EXPERIMENTS.</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">From</span> the above Facts and Experiments, it appears,</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">That</span> the Frog, after its Head is cut off, feels pain,
and, in consequence of feeling, moves its Body and Limbs.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">As</span> the Nerves of the hind Legs are not affected by
Animal Electricity, unless it be applied lower than the fifth
Vertebra, these Nerves do not seem to be derived solely or
chiefly from the Brain or Cerebellum.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">As</span> Opium, after the Circulation ceases, affects Organs
distant from those to which it is applied, it is beyond
doubt, that the latter suffer in consequence of Sympathy
of Nerves.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">It</span> appears that, in this Animal, there is Sympathy of
Nerves after the Head is cut off; or that Sympathy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Nerves does not, in this Animal, depend entirely on the
connection of Nerves within the Head.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">As</span>, after cutting off the Head, this Animal is susceptible
of pain, and, in consequence of that, performs voluntary
motion, it appears that, in it, the Brain is not the sole
seat of the <i>Sensorium Commune</i>.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Several</span> weeks after I had taken out the lowermost
half of the Spinal Marrow, and with it the Cauda Equina,
I daily applied, for four days running, Animal Electricity
to the Sciatic Nerves, by passing a gold Probe between
them and the Os Sacrum, and excited several hundreds of
convulsions of the Thighs and Legs, and yet found that,
on laying bare the Femoral Nerves, and pinching them, the
Muscles were slightly convulsed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hence</span>, I apprehend, additional force is given to an
opinion I ventured many years ago to propose<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, that the
Nerves do not receive their energy wholly from the Head
and Spinal Marrow, but that the texture of every branch
of a Nerve is such as to furnish it, or that the structure of
each Nerve is similar to that of the Brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">From</span> the above Experiments, it appears probable, in
the highest degree, that Opium may be absorbed in such
quantity as to produce fatal symptoms.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">The</span> following circumstances concur in rendering inadmissible
an opinion lately proposed by <span class="smcap">M. Fontana</span>,
that Poisons operate by changes they produce on the mass
of Blood, or on some unknown principle connected with
the Blood.</p>

<p>a. <span class="smcap">If</span> his opinion was just, Poison introduced into a Vein
of the extremities, so as to be in contact with this unknown
principle, should operate as quickly, and in the same manner
as when the Poison is mixed with the Blood near the
Heart, which he admits is not the case<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>b. <span class="smcap">Cutting</span> the Spinal Marrow in Frogs, before applying
the Poison of the Viper to their Legs, prevents it from
killing them<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; which should not happen, if the Poison acted
on the Blood alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>c. <span class="smcap">He</span> acknowledges that an Animal bit in its Leg by a
Viper, instantaneously feels acute pain<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; and it, in like
manner, feels instantly great uneasiness when the Poison is
mixed with its Blood<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. We know for certain, that,
through the medium of the Nerves, we are instantly rendered
sensible of injury done to the most distant parts of
our Bodies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Are</span> we not, therefore, in the last mentioned Experiment,
to conclude, that the uneasiness was produced because
the Poison acted upon the Nerves of the Vessels?</p>

<p>d. <span class="smcap">In</span> like manner, Animals were convulsed as soon as
they were wounded, or received the Poison into a Blood-vessel;
and long before the Blood could have reached the
Muscles in action<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>e. <span class="smcap">As</span> soon as the distilled Water of Lauro-cerasus was
poured into the Stomach of a Pigeon, it was convulsed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
died instantly<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, that is, before the Poison could have entered
the Mass of Blood.</p>

<p>f. <span class="smcap">Many</span> years ago, I found, after cutting the Venæ
Cavæ and Aorta of a Frog, that a watery solution of Opium
poured into the Heart, occasioned, in a few minutes, convulsions
in its Legs; and, after cutting out the Heart, that
the Opium poured into the Cavity of the Abdomen affected
the Legs in like manner; although, in these Experiments,
the Circulation was not only interrupted, but the
greater part of the Blood evacuated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I therefore</span> then concluded<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, and now conclude, that
Opium and other Poisons, even after they are mixed with
the Mass of Blood, produce their fatal effects, chiefly and
almost solely, by acting on the Nerves of the Heart and
Vascular System, and, through these, affecting the whole
of the Nervous System.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><span class="smcap">SUMMARY of EXPERIMENTS made on ANIMALS
with METALLINE SUBSTANCES.</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">I shall</span> now proceed to state the several circumstances
I have observed, in my Experiments, which more
directly lead us to judge of the Nature and Cause of Animal
Electricity.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">When</span> two Plates of different Metalline Substances,
particularly of Zinc and Gold, between which a living Frog
is placed, are brought into contact with each other, those
Muscles, which are farther from the Brain and Spinal Marrow
than the Metals, are convulsed: and this effect follows,
although the Animal and Metals are placed on an inverted
glass jar, and that a stick of sealing wax is interposed between
the hand of the Operator and the Metals; that is,
although the Animal, with the Metals, be insulated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> further observed, that the Metals, disposed as
above described, excite convulsions in the Legs, after all
the parts of the Frog have been divided transversely at the
Pelvis, providing only that they are, thereafter, laid in
contact with each other.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">When</span> all the parts of a living Frog, except the large
Nerves called Sciatic, are cut transversely at the Pelvis,
and the fore part of the Animal is laid on a plate of Zinc,
supported by glass, and the hind Legs on glass; if a gold
Probe be applied so as to touch the Zinc and one of the
Legs; or a piece of Metal put under one of the Legs; the
Muscles of both Legs will be convulsed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> event is the same, after the Body of the Frog has
been cut transversely about the middle of the Spine: or
when the Legs are laid on the Zinc and the Spine on Glass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> a piece of perforated dry Paper is placed between the
gold Probe and the Muscles, there will be no convulsions;
but wet Paper interposed does not prevent the convulsions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> separating the gold Probe from the Muscles there
are no convulsions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">If</span>, after the Animal and Metals are placed as above
described, the joining of the two Legs at the Ossa Pubis is
cut, that Leg only will be convulsed with which the gold
is in contact.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">The</span> Spine of the Frog with the Zinc being placed on
one glass, and the Legs on another glass, if the gold, supported
by one hand, which we shall call the Right Hand,
be applied to the Zinc alone, and not to the Legs, these are
not convulsed. But if the Operator applies his left hand
to the Legs, or if a bystander, communicating with the
Operator by the medium of the floor only, touches them,
they are convulsed. If a stick of sealing-wax be interposed
between his right hand and the gold, or between his left
hand and the Legs; or, if the bystander, touching the
Legs, is insulated, by standing on a stool supported by
glass feet, the Legs will not be convulsed. If the insulated
bystander touches the Legs with one hand, and the
Operator with his other hand, the Legs are immediately
convulsed.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">After</span> cutting the Spine transversely under the fifth
Vertebra, and all the parts of the Pelvis, except the Sciatic
Nerves, and laying the Spine on Zinc supported by glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and the Legs on glass; if gold be applied to the Zinc, and
then to one of the Sciatic Nerves, both Legs, if they have
not been separated from each other at the Ossa Pubis, will
be convulsed<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. And this happens although a stick of sealing-wax
be interposed between the hand of the Operator
and the gold Probe, and although no Metalline Substance
touches the Legs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Experiment succeeds after denuding the Sciatic
Nerves for the length of an inch, and wiping them dry;
and it continues to succeed for an hour or more, and till
the Nerves are evidently discoloured and shrunk in their
size. And, after that, although we wet the Nerves, their
powers are not restored; shewing that the influence had
been conveyed not by wetness on the surface of the Nerves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
but by the particular matter of which Nerves are composed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> event is the same, when the upper ends of the Sciatic
Nerves are cut away from the Spine, and laid on the
Zinc.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">After</span> preparing the Frog and placing the Metals as
in last Experiment, if a piece of thin dry Paper, pierced
with a number of small holes, be interposed between the
gold Probe and the Sciatic Nerves, the Legs will not be
convulsed. But, if the Paper be wetted, although it is not
perforated, the Legs will be convulsed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> preparing a Frog, as in last Experiment, and laying
the Spine on one glass, and the Legs on another, if the
Zinc be laid on a third glass, and the gold Probe applied to
it and to the Sciatic Nerves, the Legs will not be convulsed.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">If</span> the Spine and hind Legs, connected by the Sciatic
Nerves, are all laid on the same plate of Zinc, supported
by glass, the Legs are not convulsed on touching the Zinc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
with the gold Probe held in the right hand, although the
left hand is applied to the Legs.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">If</span> several Frogs, prepared as above described, are
laid upon glass, in a straight line touching each other, and
that the first Frog is supported on Zinc, and the last upon
Gold; if one end of a brass wire is applied to the Zinc, and
the other end of it to the Gold; the Muscles of all the
Frogs will be convulsed. The event is the same, although
a stick of sealing-wax be interposed between the hand of the
Operator and the brass wire: that is, although the Frog
with the Metals be insulated.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">When</span> Frogs are prepared as in last Experiment, and
the Spine of the first of them laid on Zinc, and the last supported
by the left hand of the Operator, if with a gold
Probe, held in his right hand, he touches the Zinc, the
Muscles of all the Frogs will be convulsed. But if the hind
Legs, as well as the Spine, of the first Frog be laid on the
Zinc, the Muscles of that Frog will not be convulsed.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap">After</span> a Frog was prepared as before described, I
cut the Sciatic Nerves where they are about to enter the
Thighs, and laid their cut ends in contact with the Muscles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and then touched the Zinc and Nerves with a gold Probe,
without exciting convulsions in the Thighs or Legs.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap">After</span> cutting the Sciatic Nerves, I tied together
their divided parts, and then touched the Zinc and Nerves
above the Ligature, with the Gold, without finding that the
Legs were convulsed, when the Zinc supporting the Spine
was laid on one glass and the Legs on another: but when
the Metals and parts of the Frog were laid on a wet Table,
the Muscles of the Leg were convulsed.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap">When</span> the Sciatic Nerves have been cut and rejoined
by Ligature, if while the Gold is, with one hand, applied
to the Zinc and Nerves, above the Ligature, the
other hand touches the Feet, the Legs are convulsed.</p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap">If</span> the two hind Legs of a Frog are separated from
each other, and their Sciatic Nerves afterwards tied to
each other; if one of the Legs be laid on Zinc supported
by glass, and the other Leg on glass, when, with one hand,
the Toes of one of the Legs are touched, whilst with the
other hand a gold Probe is applied to the Zinc and Nerve
of the Leg which it supports, this Leg only will be convulsed.
But if the gold Probe touching the Zinc be applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to the Nerve of the most distant Leg, both Legs will be
convulsed.</p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap">I found</span> it was not necessary, in order to excite
convulsions, that either of the Metals should be in contact
with the living Nerve or living Flesh of the Frog; for if,
after separating from each other the hind Legs of a Frog,
and cutting transversely the upper part of their Sciatic
Nerves, I laid a piece of putrid or boiled beef between
their Sciatic Nerves, and two other pieces of putrid or
boiled beef between their Toes and a plate of Zinc; if,
with the point of a gold Probe, the side of which was applied
to the piece of beef placed between the Sciatic Nerves,
I touched the Zinc, both Legs were convulsed.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap">In</span> like manner, when I placed alternately, in a
straight line, a number of dead and living Frogs touching
each other, and in the living Frogs cut, at their Pelvis, all
the parts but the Sciatic Nerves; if, with my left hand I
touched a dead Frog at one end of the line, and with a
gold Probe, held in my right hand, I touched a plate of
Zinc, on which a dead Frog was laid at the other end of
the line or chain of Frogs, the Muscles of all the living
Frogs were convulsed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap">When</span> a chain of living and dead Frogs was formed,
as in the two last Experiments, but without cutting at their
Pelvis all the parts but the Nerves; on applying the gold
to the Zinc, convulsions of the Muscles were not excited.</p>

<p>18. <span class="smcap">It</span> has been found, that, if a plate of Zinc is applied
to the upper part of the point of the Tongue, and a plate
of Silver to its under part, on bringing the two Metals into
contact with each other, a pungent disagreeable feeling,
which it is difficult to describe, is produced in the point of
the Tongue. And if a plate of Zinc is placed between the
upper lip and the gums, and a plate of gold applied to the
upper or under part of the Tongue, on bringing these two
Metals into contact with each other, the person imagines
that he sees a flash of lightning, which, however, a bystander
in a dark room does not perceive; and the person
performing the Experiment perceives the flash, though he
is hoodwinked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been alleged, that the Flash happens before the
two Metals touch each other, and is repeated on separating
them; but these facts appear to me very doubtful, as I do
not find that a Flash is produced when a piece of Cambric-paper,
in which a number of holes is pierced with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a pin, is interposed between the Zinc and Silver, although
the Paper does not in thickness exceed 1/1500 part of an
inch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> performing this Experiment repeatedly, I constantly
felt a pain in my upper jaw at the place to which
the Zinc had been applied, which continued for an hour
or more: And in one Experiment after I had applied a
blunt Probe of Zinc to the Septum Narium, and repeatedly
touched with it a Crown piece of Silver applied to the
Tongue, and thereby produced the appearance of a Flash,
several drops of Blood fell from that Nostril; and Dr
<span class="smcap">Fowler</span>, after making such an Experiment on his Ears,
observed a similar effect<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> farther observed, that although the previous application
of a second plate of Silver to one half of the plate
of Zinc, does not prevent the Flash when the other half of
the plate of Zinc, touching the Tongue, is brought into contact
with the first piece of Silver placed between the lip and
the gum; yet if the Zinc and Silver are in the first place
applied to each other, then placed between the lip and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
gum, and, after this, touched with the Tongue, there is no
appearance of a Flash, although some degree of pungency and
a disagreeable sensation is perceived by the Tongue: and a
mixed mass, composed of one part of Zinc and two parts of
Quicksilver, or a mass composed of three parts of Zinc and
one of Silver, incorporated in a furnace, have not the effect,
when they are applied to Nerves, of exciting convulsions
of the Muscles in which the Nerves terminate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> also found, that two thick pieces of raw or boiled
flesh, one between the Zinc and Tongue, and the other between
the Silver and Tongue, do not prevent the disagreeable
pungent sensation when the two Metals touch:
and, in like manner, that the interpolation of two pieces of
flesh between the Zinc and Tongue, and between the Silver
and the upper Lip, does not prevent the appearance
of a flash, on bringing the two Metals into contact.</p>

<p>19. <span class="smcap">I put</span> a very thick plate of Zinc into a vessel with
water, and placed, near to it, in the water, the under part
of the Spine and the hind Legs of a Frog, after cutting all
the parts at the Pelvis except the Sciatic Nerves. I then
touched the Zinc with a gold Probe, and found, that, when
I touched that part of the Zinc which was above the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the Legs of the Frog were not affected; but when I touched
that part of the Zinc which was below the surface of the
water, the Legs of the Frog were convulsed<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I next</span> put into the water one of the hind Legs of a dead
Frog, and its other Leg into an adjoining vessel with water.
Into the opposite side of the second vessel, I put one of the
hind Legs of a living Frog, in which all the parts at the
Pelvis, except the Sciatic Nerves, were cut; and into a
third glass vessel with water, I put its other Leg. When
I now touched that part of the Zinc, which was below the
surface of the water with a gold Probe, the Legs were not
convulsed; but, if I, at the same time, dipped the finger of
my other hand into the water contained in the third vessel,
they were convulsed: when, instead of my finger, I dipped
into the water a stick of sealing-wax, held in my other hand,
the Legs were not convulsed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I found</span>, by the three following Experiments, that the
Muscles are convulsed, whether the Influence, produced by
the application of the Metals, passes upwards or downwards
along the Nerves.</p>

<p>20. <span class="smcap">I cut</span> four living Frogs transversely at the middle
part of their Spines, and threw away the fore parts of
their Bodies and their Abdominal Viscera.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I next</span> cut, at their <i>Pelves</i> all the Parts but the Sciatic
Nerves; and at their Knees, I cut all the Parts but the
Crural Nerves; and, in all of them, I cut asunder the
joining of the two hind Legs at their Ossa Pubis. I then
laid the Legs of all of them in a straight line, supported
on different Glass Vessels inverted, in such a manner
that the Foot of one Frog touched the Foot of the next
to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> then placed a Plate of Zinc under the Foot of
the first Frog, and holding in my left hand the Foot of the
fourth or last Frog, I touched the Zinc with a gold Probe
which I held in my right hand; and found that all the
Muscles of the Loins, Thighs and Legs of the four Frogs
were convulsed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>21. <span class="smcap">When</span> I placed the two Frogs in the middle, with
their Spines contiguous to each other, and the Feet of both
touching the Spines of the other two Frogs forming the
Extremities of the Chain, and of course the Feet of one
of these resting on the Zinc, and the Feet of the other supported
by my left hand: On touching the Zinc with the
gold Probe held in my right hand, all the Muscles of the
Frogs were, as before, convulsed.</p>

<p>22. <span class="smcap">When</span> I now turned aside the right Legs of all the
Frogs, so that they did not form a Chain by touching the
next Frogs; the right Legs were not convulsed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is evident, that in whatever direction we suppose the
influence to have passed in its Circle, it must, in Experiment
20th, have passed up one Leg and down the other in
the same Frog: And, in Experiment 21st, if it passed from
one end of the Chain to the other end of it, it must have
passed upwards in two of the Frogs, and downwards in
the other two; or if the influence passed from the two
ends of the Chain towards its middle, where the Spines of
the two middlemost Frogs were contiguous, it must have
passed upwards in all of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>23. <span class="smcap">When</span> after cutting four living Frogs transversely
at the middle of their Spines, but without cutting at their
Pelves all the Parts but the Sciatic Nerves, I placed the
hind Parts of them in a Chain, as in Experiments 20th, 21st
and 22d, the Muscles were not convulsed on applying the
Gold to the Zinc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I next</span> found, that after placing in contact with each
other the several Muscles which had been cut transversely
in Experiments 20th, 21st and 22d, allowing the Nerves to
remain undivided, the muscles were not convulsed when
I touched the Plate of Zinc with the gold Probe held in my
right hand, although I touched the other end of the Chain
of Frogs with my left hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reason why the Muscles were convulsed in Experiments
20th, 21st and 22d, and not in Experiment 23d, evidently
is, that in the former, the influence was concentrated
in the Nerve, in the latter the influence was diffused;
that is, was in part conveyed by other Organs, as well as
by the Trunks of the Nerves.</p>

<p>24. <span class="smcap">After</span> finding that I could readily excite Convulsions
in the hind Legs of a Frog, without cutting it, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
laying its Back on a Plate of Zinc, and introducing a
gold Probe within its Intestinum Rectum and touching the
Zinc with the side of the Probe, I produced two or three
hundred Convulsions, succeeding each other quickly, and
observed that its Legs were, by these means, so much
weakened, that it could not jump, and crawled with difficulty,
but in a few minutes it recovered nearly the full
force of its Muscles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> other Frogs I passed a gold Wire between their Sciatic
Nerves and Os Sacrum, and twisted together the two
ends of the Wire over the Backs of the Animals. I then
put them into a Zinc Vessel filled with Water, or into a
Glass Vessel filled with Water, in the bottom of which I
laid a large Plate of Zinc: So that every time the Animals
by moving separated the Gold from the Zinc, and
again brought them into contact, their hind Legs were
convulsed. I allowed them to remain three or four days
in this situation, and found that their Limbs were weakened
considerably, but not exhausted of their Power of
Motion; and, after removing the gold Wire, the Limbs
by degrees recovered their strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I made</span> the same Experiment on those Frogs in which I
had, six weeks before, cut out, from behind, all that part
of their Spinal Marrow which is covered by the six undermost
Vertebræ, and found, several days after the Frogs had
been subjected to the Experiment, that, by pinching their
Sciatic and Femoral Nerves, and still more readily by the
application of the Gold and Zinc, weak convulsions of the
Muscles were excited.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap">After</span> Frogs were prepared as above described, by
cutting their Spines transversely, and then all the parts of
their Pelves, except their Sciatic Nerves, I found that slight
Electrical Shocks, or a Leyden Phial discharged directly
through the Limbs of a Frog, or indirectly by the medium
of water, produced convulsions in their Muscles, exactly
resembling those excited by the Metals. And when, after
moderate Electrical Shocks had been passed repeatedly
through their Legs, the Metals were applied to their
Nerves, in the manner before mentioned, the Muscles were
convulsed. I found, likewise, that after cutting the Nerves
transversely, and tying them together, Electrical Shocks
were conducted by the Nerves, and occasioned convulsions
of the Muscles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I had killed Frogs, by discharging through
them, from their foreheads to their hind feet, large Leyden
Phials highly charged, I found their Nerves or Muscles, or
both, so much deranged, that feeble convulsions only could
be excited by pinching the Nerves, or by applying the Metals
to them.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="c35" id="c35">c35</a></p>

<h2 class="p4"><span class="smcap">SUMMARY of FACTS proved by the foregoing
EXPERIMENTS.</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">On</span> reviewing the foregoing Experiments, we shall find
the following Facts fully proved.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">On</span> forming a Circle by means of the parts of a living
Animal and of two different metallic Bodies, especially
Gold and Zinc, in contact with each other, if a Nerve
makes part of the Circle, the Muscles in which the Nerve
terminates are convulsed.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Although</span> the Nerve making part of such a Circle
has been cut transversely, yet, if the divided parts of the
Nerve are laid in contact with each other, or tied together,
the Muscles, in which it naturally terminates, are convulsed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">If</span> the Metals, composing parts of the Circle, are kept
steadily in contact with each other, the convulsions of the
Muscles cease. But, if they are separated from each other
and again rejoined, the convulsions are repeated.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">The</span> effects are the same, although the dead parts of
an Animal or pure water make parts of the Circle.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Although</span> the dead parts of an Animal, making part
of such a Circle, are in contact with the Metals, the effects
are the same.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">A muscle</span> making part of such a Circle may be convulsed
whilst the matter put in motion is passing in the direction
from the Muscle to the Nerve.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">The</span> Muscle may be convulsed although it makes no
part of the Circle in which the matter put in motion passes,
as appears from comparing Experiment 5th with Experiments
13th and 14th. From Experiment 13th, it appears,
that the Fluid put in Motion by the Metals passes readily
along a Nerve, after it has been cut, providing the divided
Parts of it are brought into contact with each other. Yet
in Experiment 14th, in which the left hand of the Operator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was not applied to the Foot of the Frog, the Muscles in
which the Nerve, lower than the Ligature, terminated, were
not convulsed, because the Fluid put in motion did not descend
lower than the place at which the gold Probe touched
the Nerve above the Ligature. We may therefore presume
that when a Nerve which has not been cut, as in Experiment
5th, is touched with the gold Probe, the Fluid
put in motion does not pass lower in the Nerve than the
place of the Probe. Hence we perceive the error of those
who suppose that the moisture on the surface of the Nerve
conduces the Fluid put in motion to the Muscles, and that
their action is in consequence of the direct operation of
this Fluid upon their Fibres.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">The</span> effects are the same when the Animal and the
Metals are insulated, by being placed on Glass, whilst Sealing-wax
is interposed between the hand of the Operator
and the Metals.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">If</span> any part of the Circle is composed of Sealing-wax or
Glass, the Muscles are not convulsed.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">Convulsions</span> are not excited unless the Metals are
in contact with each other; and unless both Metals are also
in contact with the Animal Substances or the Water making
part of the Circle.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><span class="smcap">RESEMBLANCE of the FLUID put in MOTION by
the foregoing EXPERIMENTS to the ELECTRICAL FLUID.</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> Fluid set in motion by the application of the Metals
to each other, and to Animal Bodies or to Water, agrees
with or resembles the Electrical Fluid in the following respects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> the Electrical Fluid, it communicates the sense of
pungency to the Tongue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> the Electrical Fluid, it is conveyed readily by Water,
Blood, the Bodies of Animals, the Metals; and is arrested
in its course by Glass, Sealing-Wax, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> passes, with similar rapidity, through the Bodies of
Animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> the Electrical Fluid, it excites the activity of the
Vessels of a living Animal, as the Pain it gives and Hemorrhagy
it produces seem to prove. Hence perhaps it might
be employed with advantage in Amenorrh&oelig;a.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> excites Convulsions of the Muscles in the same manner,
and with the same effects as Electricity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Metals and Animal are kept steadily in contact
with each other, the Convulsions cease, or an Equilibrium
seems to be produced, as after discharging a Leyden
Phial.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><span class="smcap">The NERVOUS FLUID or ENERGY not the same
with the ELECTRICAL nor with the FLUID put
in motion by the foregoing EXPERIMENTS.</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">That</span> the Nervous Fluid is the same with the Electrical,
or with the Fluid which is put in motion by the foregoing
Experiments, is, I apprehend, disproved by the following
circumstances.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Without</span> stating the difficulty there is in conceiving
how the Electrical Fluid can be accumulated by or confined
within our Nervous System, we may observe that
where the Electrical Fluid, or Fluid resembling that put in
motion by the foregoing Experiments, is accumulated by
an Animal, such as the Torpedo or Gymnotus, a proper
apparatus is given to the Animal, by means of which it is
enabled to collect and to discharge this Fluid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">The</span> Nervous Power is excited by chemical or by mechanical
Stimuli; and, on the other hand, is destroyed by
Opium and other Poisons, which cannot be imagined to act
on the Electrical Fluid.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">I have</span>, I apprehend, refuted the theory of Doctors
<span class="smcap">Galvani</span>, <span class="smcap">Valli</span> and others, which supposes that the
Nerve is electrified <i>plus</i> and the Muscle <i>minus</i>, resembling
the Leyden Phial, by shewing that the Muscles are convulsed
where there is no communication between them and the
Metals, but by the medium of the Nerve; or when the Metals
are applied to different parts of the Nerve alone, without
touching the Muscles which are convulsed, and when
the Muscle which is convulsed makes no part of the Circle
in which the Matter that is put in motion passes.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">I have</span> proved, that the Muscles are convulsed whilst
the current of the Electrical Matter is passing from them
and from the smaller Branches of the Nerves into their
Trunks; and as a Muscle is never thrown into Action by
the Nervous Energy, except when this passes from the
Trunk of the Nerve into its Branches, and from these into
the Muscle, it appears that when, in these Experiments, the
Muscles were convulsed, the Nervous and the Electrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Fluids were moving in opposite Directions; from which we
may infer, that, in their Nature, they differ essentially from
each other.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">The</span> Nervous Energy is stopped by a tight Ligature
or by the transverse Incision of a Nerve, although its divided
Parts are thereafter placed in contact with each other;
whereas the Electrical Fluid or the Fluid excited
by the Metals, passes readily, downwards or upwards,
along a Nerve which has been tied or cut.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">After</span> the Limb of a living Animal has been amputated,
frequent Convulsions of the same Muscles may be excited
by applying Mechanical or Chemical Stimuli to
its Nerves; whereas Electrical Matter discharges itself
suddenly.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="c42" id="c42">c42</a></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hence</span> I conclude,</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">That</span> the Fluid, which, on the application of Metalline
Bodies to Animals, occasions Convulsions of their Muscles,
is electrical, or resembles greatly the Electrical Fluid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">That</span> this Fluid does not operate directly on the
Muscular Fibres, but merely by the Medium of their
Nerves.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">That</span> this Fluid and the Nervous Fluid or Energy
are not the same, but differ essentially in their Nature.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">That</span> this Fluid acts merely as a Stimulus to the
Nervous Fluid or Energy.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">That</span> these Experiments have merely shown a new
mode of exciting the Nervous Fluid or Energy, without
throwing any farther or direct Light on the nature of this
Fluid or Energy.</p>

Very small portions of different metals, applied as above described, have
astonishing effects; and although I have found that large portions of the metals
produced convulsions, when smaller had failed, or that they produced stronger
convulsions; yet the effects are by no means proportioned to the weight of the
metals employed, nor to the extent of their surfaces which are suddenly brought
into contact. In most of my Experiments, I employed a plate of Zinc, about
five inches long, three inches broad, and about one-third of an inch thick; and a
gold Probe, somewhat thicker and longer than the Probes Surgeons commonly
use.</p>

After reading to the Royal Society, on the 3d of June, an account of this
Experiment, which I had made in the beginning of May, I found, from an ingenious
publication of my Pupil Dr <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>, which I received that evening,
that the same Experiment had been performed by him.</p>
